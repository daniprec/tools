# Tools

This repository contains a set of small scripts to perform several tasks that I find useful in my daily activities.

## Install dependencies

I recommend installing an environment using [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#installing).

```cmd
conda env create -f environment.yml --force
```
